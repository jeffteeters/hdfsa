Programs for storing a large finite-state automaton using a high dimensional
superposition vector and a sparse distributed memory.

This repository has programs which are used to test storing a large
finite-state automaton using both a high dimensional superposition vector
and a sparse distributed memory and comparing the performance of both methods
when they are using the same amount of storage space.

The programs were used to generate the figures for a paper submitted in
February 2022, titled:

> On separating long- and short-term memories in hyperdimensional computing

Instructions for generating the figures in the paper that have graphs 
are in the README file in the `figures_for_paper` directory.
