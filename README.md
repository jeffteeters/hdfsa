This repository has programs which are used to test storing a large
finite-state automaton using both a high dimensional superposition vector
and a sparse distributed memory and comparing the performance of both methods
when they are using the same amount of storage space.

The programs were used to generate figures for a paper submitted to
Frontiers in Neuroscience, section Neuromorphic Engineering.  Title is:


> On separating long- and short-term memories in hyperdimensional computing


Verson 2, submitted Oct 3, 2022:

Script "plot_eedb.py" generates all graphs shown in the paper.  To
run it type:

```
python plot_eedb.py
```

The program reads data stored in a sqlite3 database named
```empirical_error_noroll_v21.db```.

That database was generated by running script ```build_eedb.py```.
The ```build_eedb.py``` script imports scripts used to compute the
empirical error.

The predicted sizes and errors are in file ```mdie.py```.  The
contents of that file (the dimensions and errors) were
generated by running script ```find_sizes2.py```.  It
imports scripts that compute the predicted error for the
different memory variations.

For version 1 of the paper, submitted in February 2022:

The programs were used to generate the figures for a paper submitted in
February 2022, titled:

> On separating long- and short-term memories in hyperdimensional computing

Instructions for generating the figures 
are in the README file in the `figures_for_paper` directory.
